Welcome to the New Heap Beta Looker block. This repository is currently _under construction_ but stay tuned for incoming features on user-journey-exploration.


# User Journey Analysis:

1. Make sure custom visualizations are turned on in your lab settings
2. Make sure Perstitant Derived Tables under connections are turned on
3. Make a new visualization under platform using the link here: https://4mile.github.io/sunburst.js
4. Update the model file to reflect your warehouse connection name
5. Copy and Paste these files into a blank lookml project
